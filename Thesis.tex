I, Niall Trinder, declare that this thesis titled, `Supervised \& Unsupervised Learning Methods to Produce Consumer Energy Profiles' and the work presented in it are my own. I confirm that:

\begin{itemize}
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] This work was done wholly or mainly while in candidature for an undergraduate degree at Cork Institute of Technology.

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where any part of this thesis has previously been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at Cork Institute of Technology or any other institution, this has been clearly stated.

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this project report is entirely my own work.

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] I have acknowledged all main sources of help.

\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where the thesis is based on work done by myself jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I have contributed myself.

Currently in developed nations, building energy consumption makes up approximately 39\% of primary energy consumption ~\cite{energy2011building}. As we see dense urban areas continue to grow and spread, strategic planning of energy infrastructure becomes more important but also more complicated

\indent In recent times, approaches to data analytics have been adopted in almost every aspect of society. As this adoption continues we see new methodologies being developed in order to deal with the ever-increasing quantity of data being generated. The challenge of capturing, storing and processing extraordinary large volumes of data is commonly referred to as big data. A major challenge of this paradigm is our ability to perform analysis and extract meaningful insights from big data in any sort of time sensitive situations. This requires intelligent and innovative solutions to overcome these challenges. This dissertation sought out to use thousands of smart meter energy consumption time series data taken from domestic dwellings to identify distinct groups or clusters. The resulting clusters were analyzed and then combined with geographic and demographic data collected from the residents. Further work is outlined in order to to use this data to predict which cluster the consumer belonged to, as such this would allow for energy demand predictions based off geographic and demographic information.
